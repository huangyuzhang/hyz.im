Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

## Lists

### Unordered

* Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
* Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:

  * Marker character change forces new list start:

    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
* Very easy!

### Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
58. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

```
// Some comments
line 1 of code
line 2 of code
line 3 of code
```

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

git style difference

```diff
function addTwoNumbers (num1, num2) {
-  return 1 + 2
+  return num1 + num2
}
```

## Latex

Use `$` and `$$` mark to define Latex equations:

* `$ e = mc $` will be rendered as: $ e = mc $
* `$$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$` will be rendered as: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$

## Marked content

```markdown
==this is content==
```

will be rendered as:

==this is content==
